HTTP is vulnerable to multiple attacks, including Man-in-the-Middle (MITM)
attacks. MITM attacks can be performed through a variety of attack vectors,
but they still tend to be localized and not global attacks. Although HTTPS
largely removes most of these attack vectors, not all websites or servers
support HTTPS and so users concerned with security were previously out of luck
if they had to access content from servers that only support HTTP.

In this paper, we introduce vHTTP, an HTTP proxy that provides mitigation
against MITM attacks for static content. vHTTP uses the concept of vantage
points to obtain multiple perspectives on what the actual response to a given
HTTP request should be, and then attempts to find consensus among those
perspectives. A response, if any, that has consensus among the different
vantage points is sent back to the user. Through this mechanism, the user can
gain confidence to the validity of the response even if they are restricted to
using HTTP.
