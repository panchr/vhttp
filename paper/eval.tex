\section{Evaluation}
\label{sec:eval}

We evaluate vHTTP on two primary metrics: effectiveness, deployability, and
performance.

\subsection{Effectiveness}

vHTTP's effectiveness is defined as its ability to mitigate different scales of
MITM attacks.

\subsection{Deployability}

A significant portion of the design considerations made for vHTTP involve the
feasibility to use it without significant configuration or infrastructure
changes required. vHTTP works with existing infrastructure, in that it uses
readily-available free (or private) HTTP proxies as vantage points. More
importantly, vHTTP can function without changes to the servers being contacted;
it operates entirely from the client-side. As a consequence, new infrastructure
or changes to existing infrastructure is not required. Security-conscious users
can make use of vHTTP as-is and gain extra confidence in the authenticity and
integrity of response contents.
